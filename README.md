# namegen
A simple Elderscrolls namegen

Made for a class project as an intro to Javascript, I chose to make my name generator produce a random name that matched the first letter of the name input into the form. For the names, I turned to the Elder Scrolls universe and sourced them from the Unofficial Wiki.

The main basis of the function was a mix of arrays, Math.randoms and a lot of if-else statements. 
I didn't know about switches and how I coud've made it so much easier to write until after I had completed the project.
